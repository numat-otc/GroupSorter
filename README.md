Team Generator V2.0 (Python tkinter user interface with manipulated V1.2 code)

V1.2
You are greeted with a command prompt window. You are firstly only able to enter a name by typing into the input sector and pressing enter. Once 2 or more names are entered you are able to sort by typing 'sort', the program asks you how many teams you would like, you enter a valid integer (2 - amount of names) and press enter and it randomly generates that amount of teams as evenly as possible with remainder names being put into the first team and onwards. The teams are printed out, clearly separated and held on the screen until the user presses enter again to return back to the starting screen. You are able to remove specific names by typing 'delete' or 'remove' and a new screen with numbers next to each name appears. You ented a numbered name to remove it or an invalid input to cancel. The name is removed from the list (if correct input given) and the screen reverts to the starting display. The last command is 'clear' where if typed, will clear the entire list of names.
